_To know how many people are in one place at now, how many have been there in the past, and if one have met infected people._

## As a citizen
You can:

* know how many people are in a place at now
* display the diagram of presences in a given place in the past
* know if you have met people infected by COVID-19

without giving any personal information, and with no GPS tracing.

Put a look at the [FAQ](http://crowded.zone/faq.php) to learn how to do that.

## As a decisor

As a decisor, you have something that is:

* [Ready to be used](http://crowded.zone), now!
* Safe and friendly: no sensitive data, no constrictions
* Free, open-source, and collaborative
* Fastly, easily, and cheaply replicable
* Natively multi-language
